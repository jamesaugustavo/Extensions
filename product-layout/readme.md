This extension is the default product layout for Shadows. The CSS is part of `/themes/%STORE_ID%/THEME_NAME/extensions.css`. If you want to make styling changes, it is recommended you add them to your `/themes/%STORE_ID%/THEME_NAME/theme.css` file.

If you are using Shadows DE, you can modify the CSS or JavaScript in `mm5/themes/%STORE_ID%/THEME_NAME/extensions/product-layout/` and update as part of your build process. This extension includes the `ajax-add-to-cart.js` functionality as well as the styles for the product photo gallery.
