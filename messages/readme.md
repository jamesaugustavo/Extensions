Shadows, and Shadows-based ReadyThemes, ship with the Messages extension included. The CSS is part of `/themes/%STORE_ID%/THEME_NAME/extensions.css` and the JavaScript is in `/themes/%STORE_ID%/THEME_NAME/extensions.js`. If you want to make styling changes, it is recommended you add them to your `/themes/%STORE_ID%/THEME_NAME/theme.css` file. The HTML for this extension can be accessed by navigating to `User Interface -> Theme Components -> Content Sections -> messages`.

If you are using Shadows DE, you can modify the CSS or JavaScript in `build/extensions/messages/` and update as part of your build process.
