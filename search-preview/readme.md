Shadows, and Shadows-based ReadyThemes, ship with the Search Preview extension included. The CSS is part of `/themes/%STORE_ID%/THEME_NAME/extensions.css`. If you want to make styling changes, it is recommended you add them to your `/themes/%STORE_ID%/THEME_NAME/theme.css` file. The HTML and JavaScript for this extension can be accessed by navigating to `User Interface -> Global Settings -> Search Settings -> Search Preview Settings`.

If you are using Shadows DE, you can modify the CSS in `mm5/themes/%STORE_ID%/THEME_NAME/extensions/search-preview/` and update as part of your build process.
