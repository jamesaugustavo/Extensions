This extension is the default mini-basket layout for Shadows. The CSS is part of `/themes/%STORE_ID%/THEME_NAME/extensions.css`. If you want to make styling changes, it is recommended you add them to your `/themes/%STORE_ID%/THEME_NAME/theme.css` file. The HTML for this extension can be accessed by navigating to `User Interface -> Global Settings -> Mini-Basket`.

If you are using Shadows DE, you can modify the CSS or JavaScript in `mm5/themes/%STORE_ID%/THEME_NAME/extensions/mini-basket/` and update as part of your build process.
