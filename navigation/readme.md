This extension is the default, primary navigation layout for Shadows. The CSS is part of `/themes/%STORE_ID%/THEME_NAME/extensions.css`. If you want to make styling changes, it is recommended you add them to your `/themes/%STORE_ID%/THEME_NAME/theme.css` file. The HTML for this extension can be accessed by navigating to `User Interface -> Theme Components -> Navigation Sets -> primary_navigation`.

If you are using Shadows DE, you can modify the CSS or JavaScript in `build/extensions/navigation/` and update as part of your build process.
