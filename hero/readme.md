This extension is the default hero layout for Shadows. The CSS is part of `/themes/%STORE_ID%/THEME_NAME/extensions.css`. If you want to make styling changes, it is recommended you add them to your `/themes/%STORE_ID%/THEME_NAME/theme.css` file.

If you are using Shadows DE, you can modify the CSS in `mm5/themes/%STORE_ID%/THEME_NAME/extensions/hero/` and update as part of your build process.
