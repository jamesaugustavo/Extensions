Shadows, and Shadows-based ReadyThemes, ship with the A11y Toggle extension included. This is an accessible replacement to the checkbox-hack for toggling sections. The CSS is part of `/themes/%STORE_ID%/THEME_NAME/extensions.css` and the JavaScript is in `/themes/%STORE_ID%/THEME_NAME/extensions.js`. If you want to make styling changes, it is recommended you add them to your `/themes/%STORE_ID%/THEME_NAME/theme.css` file.

If you are using Shadows DE, you can modify the CSS or JavaScript in `mm5/themes/%STORE_ID%/THEME_NAME/extensions/show-related/` and update as part of your build process.

You can find some additional documentation for the extension can be found at [http://edenspiekermann.github.io/a11y-toggle/](http://edenspiekermann.github.io/a11y-toggle/).
