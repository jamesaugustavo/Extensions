This extension is the default category tree layout for Shadows. The CSS is part of `/themes/%STORE_ID%/THEME_NAME/extensions.css`. If you want to make styling changes, it is recommended you add them to your `/themes/%STORE_ID%/THEME_NAME/theme.css` file. The HTML for this extension can be accessed by navigating to `User Interface -> Settings -> Category Tree Template`.

If you are using Shadows DE, you can modify the CSS in `mm5/themes/%STORE_ID%/THEME_NAME/extensions/category-tree/` and update as part of your build process.
