Dialog is an accessible modal extension which is the default modal for Shadows. The CSS is part of `/themes/%STORE_ID%/THEME_NAME/core.css`. If you want to make styling changes, it is recommended you add them to your `/themes/%STORE_ID%/THEME_NAME/theme.css` file.

If you are using Shadows DE, you can modify the CSS in `mm5/themes/%STORE_ID%/THEME_NAME/core/css/components/_dialog.scss` and update as part of your build process.
