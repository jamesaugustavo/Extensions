When using the subscription function of Miva, this is the default styling used for the date picker. The CSS is part of `/themes/%STORE_ID%/THEME_NAME/extensions.css`. If you want to make styling changes, it is recommended you add them to your `/themes/%STORE_ID%/THEME_NAME/theme.css` file.

If you are using Shadows DE, you can modify the CSS in `build/extensions/subscriptions/` and update as part of your build process.
